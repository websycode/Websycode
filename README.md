WebSyCode aims at abridging the technological gap separating the current market trends and the academics by the means of webinars, in-person consultation and running local campaigns and meetups.

We accept the application of each individual irrespective of his/her caste, creed, religion, race, ethnicity, language, beliefs, interest, sex and ailments.

## MissionðŸ’¥
Our mission is to provide enough guidance to each person who is interested in grooming his/her skills irrespective of his/her majors and family background. We want to make a strong community that can come together to solve any complex challenge and build a product that can bring revolution to the tech industry. We aim to invoke the engineer inside you!

## Agency

We have several departments to handle the community like Social media, latest affairs, collaboration groups, campus coordinator department, etc.
Each department has a secretary and a vice-secretary to look after their department. They need to report to the chief of the community who is responsible to maintain the freedom of equality among members of the community.
No one is superior inside our community, but responsibility and accountability matter. So the one who takes up the position will be appreciated. We contest elections for appointing all lead members.

Appointment criteria are set in such a way that only the most eligible candidate gets the opportunity. Position acquired with hardships always reminds the hard process and keeps the person realized about his responsibility to lead the community towards their mission and do what is in line with the interest of the community's mission. Someone has to pass the power to lead someday.

## Structure

- Community is led by a group of the board with the advisory of seniors and experienced. A chief to be appointed among board members (founding members), the one who has high order thinking capacity and hold no liabilities and the one who is active and dedicated to working with and for the community.

- Community functions in a department formed by the board. They regulate and enforce the community standards. When each works honestly, the entire community prospers.

- Departments have a secretary (joint or single) or In-charge (in absence of an eligible candidate) who reports to the boards.

- Decision-making should be based on the ratio of mutual understanding after considering the nature of advisory from boards.

- Successor will be chosen based on hours of service (majority wins) served to the community. The one who has always stayed available at odds and showed extreme leadership skills. The one free from all kinds of misconduct.
